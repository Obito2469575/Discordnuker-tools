<p><FONT COLOR = "green">A nuker is a type of hacker whose purpose is to send corrupt data to a computer and ultimately bring it to a complete halt. Discord Nuking is a massive raid on a specific Discord Server. Nuking, assuming you’re talking about the act of banning everyone and deleting every channel, is not against the rules, as the owner must have voluntarily given the user permission to take said actions, meaning at this point it is not Discord’s problem.
